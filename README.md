# FIFAplayers_project
This project was completed as part of the courses Machine Learning and Introduction to Data Science. The goal of the project was to develop a model for predicting football players' market value using various machine learning techniques.
The project involves data collection, data cleaning and preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), as well as model selection and evaluation to determine the best-performing algorithm for predicting the target variable â€” the player's market price.
This project involves the analysis of a dataset comprising approximately 17,000 football players from the FIFA database (source: soFIFA.com, https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/maso0dahmed/football-players-data). The dataset contains detailed information on individual players, including their names, nationalities, performance ratings, playing positions, and other relevant attributes.
